# specs2016
A re-writing of the specs pipeline stage from CMS, only changed quite a bit

"specs" is a command line utility for parsing and re-arranging text
input. It allows re-alignment of fields, some format conversion, and
re-formatting multiple lines into single lines or vice versa. Input
comes from standard input, and output flows to standard output.

This version is liberally based on the [**CMS Pipelines User's Guide and Reference**](https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/hcsj0c30.pdf), especially chapters 16, 24, and 20.

Sources
=======
To download your copy of *specs*, you can get it from [github](https://github.com/yoavnir/specs2016) in either of two ways:
1. Using git: `git clone https://github.com/yoavnir/specs2016.git`
2. Using http: `wget https://github.com/yoavnir/specs2016/archive/dev.zip`

Building
========
If you have downloaded a git repository, first make sure to check out a stable tag such as v0.2:
```
git checkout v0.2
```
You can also choose to checkout alpha or beta tags, but they will obviously be less stable.

After that, _cd_ to the specs/src directory, and run the following two commands:
* `make some`
* `sudo make install`

Contributing
============
Anyone can contribute. So far, I have written all of the code, but if you want to help, I'll be very happy. Feel free to:
* Submit bug reports or feature requests at the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/yoavnir/specs2016/issues).
* Help solve some existing issue.
* Submit pull requests

Documentation
=============
The documentation for *specs2016* exists in two places:
* In the *manpage* installed with the utility
* In the [docs](specs/docs/TOC.md) directory.
