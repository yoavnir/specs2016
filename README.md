# specs2016
A re-writing of the specs pipeline stage from CMS, only changed quite a bit

"specs" is a command line utility for parsing and re-arranging text
input. It allows re-alignment of fields, some format conversion, and
re-formatting multiple lines into single lines or vice versa. Input
comes from standard input, and output flows to standard output.

This version is liberally based on the [**CMS Pipelines User's Guide and Reference**](https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/hcsj0c30.pdf), especially chapters 16, 24, and 20.

Sources
=======
To download your copy of *specs*, you can get it from [github](https://github.com/yoavnir/specs2016) in either of two ways:
1. Using git: `git clone https://github.com/yoavnir/specs2016.git`
2. Using http: `wget https://github.com/yoavnir/specs2016/archive/dev.zip`

Building
========
If you have downloaded a git repository, first make sure to check out a stable tag such as v0.9.5:
```
git checkout v0.9.5
```
A simple way to get the latest stable release is to check out the `stable` branch and rebase to its tip:
```
git checkout stable
git rebase
```

After that, _cd_ to the specs/src directory, and run the following three commands:
* `python setup.py`
* `make some`
* `sudo make install`

*Note:* Windows does not need `sudo`. 

*Note:* On some Mac machines, `sudo make install` will cause a warning about being the wrong user.

Known Issues
============
* Regular expression grammars other than the default `ECMAScript` don't work except on Mac OS.
* On Windows with Python support the appropriate dll (like `python38.dll`) must be in the path.

============
